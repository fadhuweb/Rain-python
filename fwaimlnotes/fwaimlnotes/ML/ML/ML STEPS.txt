Steps Involved in building a ML Model
1. Identify and understand the business need
2. Get the data
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values / inconsistency / outliers/
range of data, encoding categorical variables etc )
5. Split data into independent and 
dependent features(select relevant independent features for training). 
6. split data into trainset and test set (70-80% : 20%-30%)
7. choose a suitable algorithm for your model 
8. train the model on the trainset using the chosen algorithm (fit method)
9. make predictions on the test set using the trained model
10. Evaluate the performance of your model using evaluation metrics
11. deploy model if performance is great. other wise, go back to step 7/8
