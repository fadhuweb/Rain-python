    "## ABSTRACTION\n",
    "Abstraction is an OOP concept that allows a programmer to hide the real implementation and users only know how to use it. In Python, we use abstract classes and interface to achieve abstraction.  An abstract class is a class that provides incomplete functionality and contains at least one abstract method. An abstract method that generally has no implementation. Child classes which inherit the abstract class provides implementation for the abstract methods. Concrete methods are methods that have implementation. "

    "**Important points about abstract class in Python**\n",
    "1. Abstract class can have both concrete methods as well as abstract methods.\n",
    "2. Abstract class works as a template for other classes. Using an abstract class you can define a generalized structure without providing complete implementation of every method. Methods which provide common functionality to be used for all derived classes are defined as concrete methods in abstract class where as the methods where implementation may vary are defined as abstract methods.\n",
    "3. Abstract class can’t be instantiated so it is not possible to create objects of an abstract class.\n",
    "4. Generally abstract methods defined in abstract class don’t have any body but it is possible to have abstract methods with implementation in abstract class. Any sub class deriving from such abstract class still needs to provide implementation for such abstract methods.\n",
    "5. If any abstract method is not implemented by the derived class Python throws an error."

At times, the implementation of a parent class method may not fit perfectly for a child class but with the concept of polymorphism, a child class can re-implement the method in its own class.
